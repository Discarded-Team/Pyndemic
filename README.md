**What is this?**

This is a simple project I've started to help me learn how to use vim, python and github. When it's finished it should let somebody play the Pandemic board game as one or more of the charaters.

I'm about to start an OU degree in computing and IT and hoping for a career in IT eventually. The role I've got my eye on is one of full stack developer https://www.sitepoint.com/full-stack-developer/, although I understand this might already be old hat https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-full-stack-developer/. So I'm going to try to learn as much code as I can and focus on completing practical fun projects with other people alongside my course. 

**How to run the code?**

I'm trying to use 'test first development' where I write the tests before I write the actual code. To run the tests the command

python -m -unittest t_makeboard
or 
python -m unittest nameoftests


**What am I trying to learn?**

I'd like to get my head round Python, SQL, and anything else relevant to make this work. I think that probably includes Git and how to use the command line in Linux (running Ubuntu at the moment). In the future I'd also like to learn

At least one kind of web server language, probably two (Apache, PHP I think)
At least one version of SQL
Some basic front end website languages (HTML, JavaScript and the like)
